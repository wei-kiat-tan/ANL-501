### Synopsis

* Long working hours are negatively associated to stress, depression, and low subjective well-being. In extreme cases, it results in death by overwork or known as “gwarosa” and “karoshi,” in South Korea and Japan.

* However, not every economy shares the same narrative. Some economies achieve better happiness results despite working for long hours. Could better working conditions for workers justify working longer? 

* Could an economy with a better GDP per capita be more advantageous starting point for people and make them happier to justify working longer? Lastly, is happiness dependent on the region economies are located due to differences in working culture?  

* This report seeks to deliver key insights that influence the relationship between work and happiness.


---
### Introduction

The relationship between work and happiness is not significant to a large extent. First, People living in Economies with higher GDP per capita tend to be happier and have a more positive outlook in life. Second, not all hardworking countries are less happy. However, improved working conditions can help to improve happiness. 

### Data Sources

* Data provided for this report consists of 3 data sources. The first contains data on average weekly hours worked among countries in the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) and for Singapore. 

* The second dataset contains additional data about work conditions for all countries with available data and contains aggregated survey responses (from each country) from the World Bank Working Hours database. 

* The third dataset contains data about happiness taken from the World Happiness Report 2024.

### Term Definitions

* In the happiness dataset, Life Ladder refers to think of their best possible life, 10 being the best and 0 for the worst. 

* Log GDP per capita is the log-transformed variable of the GDP per capita as a measure of economic development. 

* Positive Affect measures positive emotions on a scale of 0 to 1 whereby the higher the score, the more positive the emotion.

* Negative Affect measures negative emotions on a scale of 0 to 1 whereby the higher the score, the more negative the emotion.

#### Case of Turkey

* There are a few possible reasons. First, weakening of Turkey's currency Lira as Erdogan, known for his unorthodox stance in tackling inflation by not raising interest rates strongly rejected moves by Turkey's Central Bank.


* Second possible explanation is social unrest in Turkey over Syria. Anti-government protests in Turkey claimed more than 30 lives.

* Third, Crackdown of the media's freedom of expression and political opponents following a series of violence that rocked the Country in 2015. Mainstream and social media platforms were not spared from this crackdown as Turkey under President Erdogan becomes increasingly authoritative.

* Fourth, in 2016, a major coup was attempted by a faction of the Turkish Armed forces to overthrow the Turkish Government, including President Erdogan but failed.

* Lastly, Turkey suffers a currency economic crisis, plunging in value from high inflation, widening current account deficit from debt in public and private sector and lastly political instability in Turkey and with its global partners.

#### Insights From Singapore

* Based on results from figure 19.1 to 19.3, it is commendable for Singapore to achieve these while having annual average working hours above 40, demonstrating Singaporeans are generally satisfied and contented despite long working hours

* A possible explanation is Singapore’s safe and secure environment, stable government and high quality of life. Efficient law enforcement keeps Singapore streets safe against crime.

* With its particularly modern infrastructure and strong currency, it makes it a very lucrative environment to settle down for foreigners.

* Furthermore, Singapore has political stability with a political party elected since 1959 that has made wise decisions that made the country prosperous that continues till today

---
#### Insights From Singapore

* While it fails to achieve a higher life ladder rating like Finland, the government has made attempts to improve work-life balance.

* One example is starting December 1, 2024, all employers must consider workers' requests for flexible work arrangements under the new Tripartite Guidelines on Flexible Work Arrangement Requests (FWAs).

* Government announced increased parental leave from 20 weeks of paid leave to 30 weeks with employers mandated to four weeks of government-paid paternity leave from two in 2024 National Day Rally.

#### Case of Colombia, Mexico and Costa Rica

* In figure 20.1, Colombia's overall life ladder trend shows a general decline with a rebound only occuring in 2019. Working hours remain generally long with hours above 45.

* Surprisingly, despite a general trend of decline in life ladder and long working hours above 45, positive emotions rating remained surprisingly high above 0.8 from 2013 to 2015 and eventually dipping to above 0.75 but less than 0 from 2016. onwards.

* Colombia's negative emotions remain generally low despite its long workig hours but there is a notable upward trend of rising unhappiness among Colombians

#### Insights From Case of Colombia, Mexico and Costa Rica

* For these 3 Latin American countries, the fact these countries achieve higher annual average working hours while achieving high levels of happiness can be attributed to 3 common factors. 

* First, strong social connections and family values, which is part of Latin America culture. 

* Second, presence of government legislations in the form of either labour law or code to provide work-life balance 

* Lastly, a positive and resilient outlook in life, moulded by their shared experience. Latin America historically has struggled and overcame multiple economic, political crises and hardships like the 1980s debt crisis which has widened society inequality.

* Longer working hours can be attributed to the need to provide economic necessity for families to avoid future hardships and unlock more opportunities to climb up the life ladder. 

* One such example from World Economic Forum on Costa Rica is investing in education to produce human talent, which improves human well-being as providing better education unlocks better job opportunities and increases income.

#### Insight 3: Working conditions matter towards happiness

* On the other hand, improved working conditions improve happiness. Improved working conditions can be an improvement to paid annual leaves, better severance pay in cases of dismissal or both. 

* Improving working conditions can help to serve as incentive either to keep employees satisfied with their employment with their employee or reduce the pain when terminated from employment due to reasons excluding breaking the law.

* Paid annual leave means time off from work for employees and are entitled to receive pay from their employers during time off. 

* Severance pay is financial compensation that an employer provides to employees upon employee termination from work to help transit to either a new future job or unemployment. The compensation is a one-time offer.

#### Severance pay by tenure Insights

* Majority of countries not having severance pay for employees is largely attributed to a lack of government legislation, mandating need for employers to provide severance pay in event of employee termination. 

* In some economies, laws are more friendly towards employers than employees and workers

* Using Singapore as an example, according to Channel News Asia (CNA), workers who work continuously for less than 2 years with an employer are not entitled to any retrenchment benefit.

* Worker Unions like National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and the Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF) have no legal force on employers to pressure them to issue severance package in event of employee termination.

#### Insight 3: Working conditions matter towards happiness

* Plotting economies with severance pay of 1 year tenure in a dot plot in figure 26, the purpose is to compare them against one another in terms of the severance pay they offer to employees

* Mexico has the highest severance pay at 1 year tenure at approximately 14.6, rounding to the nearest decimal place. This is followed by Lithuania and Greece.</li>

* Interestingly, Brazil does not have a universal severance pay across the country. In Sao Paulo, it is 1.7 while in Rio de Janeiro, it is 1.6.

* For France, the graph shows 2 values of 0.9 and 1.1 respectively. These 2 values are due to an increase in severance pay in 2019 from 0.9 to 1.1.

#### Insight 3: Working conditions matter towards happiness

* In comparison, Mexico and Singapore falls behind with poorer life ladder in comparison to UK, France and Finland.

* This is attributed to their long working hours and lower paid annual leave. Despite suffering from no paid annual leave.

* US surprisingly does well for its life ladder, indicating other factors that help contribute to the final life ladder result.

#### Insight 3: Working conditions matter towards happiness

* Costa Rica replace Mexico for one of the lowest paid annual leave.

* Singapore continues as one of the worst performing for its life ladder when compared among the lowest paid annual leave and top 3 highest paid annual leave at 5-year tenure. 

* Costa Rica saw better life ladder than Singapore even though they have very similar paid annual leave. 

* US continues to show resilience with a better life ladder than Singapore and even France despite having no paid annual leave. 

* Surprisingly, France lacks behind in life ladder, performing worse than the US and Costa Rica despite having much higher paid leave than them. 

* Lastly, UK and Finland continue to maintain their lead with the better life ladder than their peers.

---
#### Insight 3: Working conditions matter towards happiness

* Improved working conditions like having paid annual leave can improve employees’ chances of achieving best life possible for themselves like Finland. 

* Singapore with its long working hours and limited employee protection lowers life ladder rating. 

* However, US with poor employee benefits can achieve higher life ladder than France, whereby France is well-known for generous employee benefits and compensation. 

---
#### Case of US

* A possible explanation for US is due to their work ethic, which places emphasis on hard work leading to greater accomplishments and unlocking future opportunities. 

* This means longer working hours than other countries but as a worker in America hones their skills more, they gain better proficiency, increase their wages, generating higher income levels. 

* This translates to unlocking more opportunities to pursue side hustle or hobbies and increase likelihood of achieving best life possible. This is particularly for businesses, specifically small businesses who enjoy tax breaks from the US government. 

---
#### Case of US

* Furthermore, US work culture emphasises on entrepreneurship and innovation. Entrepreneurship is an individual who has an idea, acts on it, usually to disrupt the current market with a new product or service. 

* An individual can take advantage of their personal interests, innovate and make money from it, generating income, which is another possible reason why life ladder is high even though employee benefits are poor. 

* Regarding employee benefits like paid leaves, there is no mandated legislation by the state or federal government on employers to pay for staff even when on leave.

## Conclusion

---
### Relationship between work and happiness is not significant

* Better working conditions does not necessarily justify to workers working longer as shown from results in Europe and Scandinavian regions

* Countries with better GDP per capita have better life ladder ratings, higher positive emotions and lower negative emotions.

* Furthermore, happiness is dependent on the region due to difference in region culture, making it a subjective topic to discuss since there is a different interpretation from every individual what is happiness.

* This highlights limitations of improved working conditions and emphasise complex nature of happiness and well-being.

---
### Relationship between work and happiness is not significant

* People living in poorer economic environments are less likely to pursue their passions and more inclined to work longer to make ends meet. 

* In comparison, people in wealthier societies have more opportunities to pursue hobbies or passions that make them happy.

* Region is also a fundamental factor in determining working hours, culture and happiness. That is why Europe or Scandinavian regions can have lower working hours while Latin America and Asia regions work longer.

* Importantly, access to state-of-the-art facilities like prestigious universities produces skilled human capital, allowing higher productivity per hour per headcount in wealthier societies, hence, lowering working hours required.
